    "## What is *StudyForrest*?\n",
    "\n",
    "The *StudyForrest* project centers around the use of the movie Forrest Gump, which provides complex sensory input that is both reproducible and is also richly laden with real-life-like content and contexts. While study participants listened to and watched the movie, we collected a rich dataset that encompasses many hours of fMRI scans, structural brain scans, eye-tracking data, and extensive annotations of the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from these data acquisitions, several processed derivatives have also been generated and shared. These include functional contrasts, cortical and subcortical brain parcellations, retinotopic maps, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *StudyForrest* and all its derivatives are structured as a nested DataLad dataset that is accessible publicly and provides fine-grained data access down to the level of individual files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is *DataLad*?\n",
    "\n",
    "DataLad is a free and open-source distributed data management system, available for all major operating systems, that was developed to aid with everything related to the evolution of digital objects. As explained in the DataLad Handbook:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *It is not only keeping track of code, it is not only keeping track of data, it is not only making sharing, retrieving and linking data (and metadata) easy, but it assists with the combination of all things necessary in the digital workflow of data and science.*\n",

This is made seamless with the use of DataLad and various other open source software packages, which are already installed in this Binder instance and ready to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "- All code/Markdown cells can be run using the keyboard shortcut: `Shift + Enter` or `Shift + Return`\n",
    "- It is important to run all of the cells in order from top to bottom. This is important because Jupyter Notebooks keep a global context, i.e. it remembers the results of the code that was recently executed, and takes that into account when running new code cells. For example, if you run a code cell to list the contents of a directory, then run a next cell to navigate to a different directory, then rerun the first cell, it will list the contents of the directory that you navigated to, not the one where you were originally located.\n",
    "- If you get stuck or receive errors due to running the cells in a different order, you can restart the kernel in the `Kernel` menu option above.\n",
